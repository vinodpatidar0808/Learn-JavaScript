// Expression : a piece of code that produces a value. for eg. 3+4 , 3>=2,  45775, true && false && !false

//statement: a bigger piece of code and which does not produce a value on its own. analogous to sentences in spoken language and expressions are like words

// the if statement
if (23 > 10) {
    // whole line is a statement and "23 is bigger" is an expression
    const str = '23 is bigger';
}


// js expects statements and expressions eg.
// in template literals you can only insert expression but not statements
