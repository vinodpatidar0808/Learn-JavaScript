//value is a piece of information
// 'vinod' -->this is a value
//  you can have different values
// this 4 numbers are also different values
console.log(40 - 23 + 10 + 1);

//variable
let variableName = 'Vinod';
//above line creates a variable in your computer's memory with value = vinod

let lastName = 'Patidar';
// you can use varible as many times as you like in your program
// this will print value of variable lastName
console.log(lastName);
console.log(lastName);
console.log(lastName);

//with variables you whenever you need to change value of lastName you have to change it only once

//conventions and rules of variable naming
//  1. camel casing: first letter small and rest words have first letter in caps like firstName , if only one word in variable-> first/name etc
//  2. you can use underScores also --> but camelCasing is standard in js ecosystem
//  3. you can not have first letter as a number like -> 3bowls-> invalid, syntax error
//  4. varibales can only contain numbers, letters (caps and small ) , underscores. and dollar ($) sign only. something like this fist&name will be invalid
//  5.  variable can not be named as reserved keywords like new , class etc
//  6. name is also reserved keyword
//  7. never start variable name with first letter in caps
//  8. constants like PI should be named  in all caps
//  9. make your variable names descriptive -> not required by js ğŸ˜Š, but it's a good practice to write readable and clean code
